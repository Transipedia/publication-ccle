# Validation of `REINDEER` Quantification in Different Situations

This folder contains scripts to evaluate `REINDEER` quantification of arbitrary sequences in diverse situations, reproducing figures in preprint article [[C. Bessi√®re, et. al. (2024)]](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.27.581927).

The `run.sh` script indicates analysis workflow.

The two scripts `a_cmp1000ERV.R` and `b_cmp2REdiscoverTE.R` compare `REINDEER`'s quantification of transcposable elements to either `Telescope` or `REdiscoverTE`, respectively.

These scripts reproduces Fig4 A-B, FigS6 and FigS7 of the article.
